API\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the OpenStorage API documentation. Here you will find the\nAPI functions, examples, and references to multiple client libraries which can\ncommunicate with an OpenStorage server.\nQuick Example\nHere is a quick example of how to get cluster information from an OpenStorage\nserver. In this example we will be using the mock SDK container as the\nserver. First let's start the container by running the following command:\n$ docker run --rm --name sdk -d -p 9100:9100 -p 9110:9110 openstorage/mock-sdk-server\nThis container starts a tiny, in-memory OpenStorage SDK server able to be used\nfor development. More information can be found in the Tutorial.\nNow we can send requests from the command line. To send requests to the gRPC\nserver, we will use Polyglot\nas the gRPC client. To send requests to the gRPC REST Gateway, we will be\nsending the same request as Polyglot, but using curl instead:\ngRPCREST$ wget https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/polyglot/releases/download/v1.6.0/polyglot.jar\n$ echo {} | java -jar polyglot.jar \\\n  --command=call \\\n  --endpoint=localhost:9100 \\\n  --full_method=openstorage.api.OpenStorageCluster/InspectCurrent$ curl -X GET \"http://localhost:9110/v1/clusters/current\" \\\n     -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n\t -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\t -d \"{}\"\nResults in:\n{\n  \"cluster\": {\n    \"status\": \"STATUS_OK\",\n    \"id\": \"mock\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe mock-sdk-server container also comes with a full Swagger\nUI located at http://localhost:9110/swagger-ui/.\nWhat's next\nCheck out:\n\nArchitecture\nInstallation\nTutorials\n\n"},"arch.html":{"url":"arch.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\n\nOverview\nThe software development kit for OpenStorage is based on gRPC,\nallowing clients to be automatically generated in multiple languages.

Each tutorial will provide an introduction to programming\nyour OpenStorage system.\nSetting up the mock-sdk-server\nFor simplicity these tutorials will use the mock-sdk-server provided by the\nOpenStorage project. It is an in-memory storage system implementation of the\nOpenStorage SDK and it makes it possible to develop your client by simply\nrunning a container on your laptop or system.\nRun the following command to start the server:\n$ docker run --rm --name sdk -d -p 9100:9100 -p 9110:9110 openstorage/mock-sdk-server\nRunning this docker command will expose port 9100 for the gRPC server, and\nport 9110 for the gRPC REST Gateway connection. As shown in the Architecture,\nthe gRPC REST Gateway translates simple REST requests to gRPC requets.\nThis document assumes that you will be running the container on your system,\ntherefore it will refer to the connetion as localhost. If you have the container\nrunning on another system, you will need to change the server location\naccordingly.\nLet's test the connection now before continuing by running the following to the\ngRPC REST Gateway:\n$ curl -X GET \"http://localhost:9110/v1/cluster\" \\\n     -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d \"{}\"\nThis should return information about the cluster in JSON format, for example:\n{\"cluster\":{\"status\":\"STATUS_OK\",\"id\":\"mock\"}}\n\n"},"tutorial-golang.html":{"url":"tutorial-golang.html","title":"Golang","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial: Golang\nIn this tutorial you will learn to setup your environment, create a volume,\nthen take its snapshot, create cloud credentials, and create a backup of the\nvolume.\nThe sources for this tutorial are available in the examples/golang directory in the repo for this website.\nSetting up your environment\nTo setup your environment, you will need to import the following to gain\naccess to api.pb.go:\nimport (\n    \"github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/api\"\n\n    \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n    \"google.golang.org/grpc/status\"\n)\n\nOnce you have imported this library into your project, you will have access\nto the OpenStorage SDK Golang client which was generated from the protobuf\nfile api.proto.\nWith the mock-sdk-server\nrunning, the following steps will provide an introduction to programming\nwith the OpenStorage SDK.\nCreating a connection\nTo use any of the gRPC functions, you must first create a connection with\nthe OpenStorage SDK server:\n    // Setup a connection\n    conn, err := grpc.Dial(\"localhost:9100\", grpc.WithInsecure())\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error: %v\", err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n\nNOTE: Notice the call grpc.WithInsecure(). The mock-sdk-server\ncurrently does not support HTTPS or authentication, so the tutorial will\nonly focus on an insecure connection. The SDK project will add HTTPS and\nauthentication support in following releases.\n\nCluster operations\nNow that we have made a connection, we can use the conn object to create\nclients for each of the services we would like to use. Let's use the OpenStorageCluster\nservice to print the id of the cluster and how many nodes it has:\n    // Create a cluster client\n    cluster := api.NewOpenStorageClusterClient(conn)\n\n    // Print the cluster information\n    clusterInfo, err := cluster.InspectCurrent(\n        context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkClusterInspectCurrentRequest{})\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Connected to Cluster %s\\n\",\n        clusterInfo.GetCluster().GetId())\n\nNotice the status.FromError() call above. As mentioned in the\nArchitecture all errors are encoded using the\nstandard gRPC status. To gain access to the error code and its message you\nmust use status.FromError() which decodes the error value and the message.\nNotice also the use of accessors GetXXX() above. These convenient functions\nare provided automatically be the golang protobuf generator.\nVolume Operations\nNow that we have connected to the cluster, let's go ahead and create a\nvolume of size 100Gi:\n    // Create a 100Gi volume\n    volumes := api.NewOpenStorageVolumeClient(conn)\n    v, err := volumes.Create(\n        context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkVolumeCreateRequest{\n            Name: \"myvol\",\n            Spec: &api.VolumeSpec{\n                Size: 100 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,\n            },\n        })\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Volume 100Gi created with id %s\\n\", v.GetVolumeId())\n\nNotice the value of Name provided above. This value is important since\nit allows for the function to be idempotent. In other words, this function\nwill always return the same volume id for the volume of same name.\nYou can now create a snapshot of this volume:\n    snap, err := volumes.SnapshotCreate(\n        context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkVolumeSnapshotCreateRequest{\n            VolumeId: v.GetVolumeId(),\n        },\n    )\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Snapshot with id %s was create for volume %s\\n\",\n        snap.GetSnapshotId(),\n        v.GetVolumeId())\n\nBackup\nIn this section we will be making a backup of our volume to a cloud provider.\nTo do this, we must first create a set of credentials which will enable\nthe storage system to save the backup in the cloud.\n    // Create mock credentials\n    creds := api.NewOpenStorageCredentialsClient(conn)\n    credResponse, err := creds.Create(context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkCredentialCreateRequest{\n            CredentialType: &api.SdkCredentialCreateRequest_AwsCredential{\n                AwsCredential: &api.SdkAwsCredentialRequest{\n                    AccessKey: \"dummy-access\",\n                    SecretKey: \"dummy-secret\",\n                    Endpoint:  \"dummy-endpoint\",\n                    Region:    \"dummy-region\",\n                },\n            },\n        })\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    credID := credResponse.GetCredentialId()\n    fmt.Printf(\"Credentials created with id %s\\n\", credID)\n\nNotice above the CredentialType.AwsCredential. This is struct was\ngenerated from the protobuf concept of oneof. Oneof\nstates that one of these types will be used. In SdkCredentialCreateRequest, oneof is used as a method of determining which\ntype of cloud provider is being requested.\nThe backup of the volume can now be started with the newly acquired\ncredential id:\n    // Create a backup to a cloud provider of our volume\n    cloudbackups := api.NewOpenStorageCloudBackupClient(conn)\n    _, err = cloudbackups.Create(context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkCloudBackupCreateRequest{\n            VolumeId:     v.GetVolumeId(),\n            CredentialId: credID,\n        })\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Backup started for volume %s\\n\", v.GetVolumeId())\n\nThis request will not block while the backup is running.

the Create() call for a specified\nvolume. To see the status of this request, use Status() which returns\na map where the keys are the source volume id.\nRestore\nTo restore, you would pass a backup_id of a successful backup.\nbackup_id can be retreived by calling Enumerate() for a specified volume.\nPass this backup_id and a new volume name to Restore() to start\nrestoring a new volume from an existing backup. To see the status of this\nrestore, pass volume id returned by Restore() to input to Status()\nCreate\n\nrpc Create(SdkCloudBackupCreateRequest)\n    SdkCloudBackupCreateResponse\n\nCreates a backup request for a specified volume. Use\nOpenStorageCloudBackup.Status() to get the current status of the\nbackup request.\nRestore\n\nrpc Restore(SdkCloudBackupRestoreRequest)\n    SdkCloudBackupRestoreResponse\n\nRestore creates a new volume from a backup id. The newly created volume\nhas an ha_level (number of replicas) of only 1. To increase the number of\nreplicas, use OpenStorageVolume.Set() to change the ha_level.\nDelete\n\nrpc Delete(SdkCloudBackupDeleteRequest)\n    SdkCloudBackupDeleteResponse\n\nDelete deletes a backup stored in the cloud.

This is necessary as a separate variable because values like int and bool in the VolumeSpec cannot be determined if they are being requested to change in gRPC proto3. Some of these values may not be able to be changed. Here are a few examples of actions that can be accomplished using the VolumeSpec. To resize the volume: Set a new value in spec.size. To change number of replicas: Adjust spec.ha_level. To change the I/O Profile: Adjust spec.io_profile.\n\n\n\n \n \nSdkVolumeUpdateResponse \nEmpty response\n \nSnapCreateRequest \nSnapCreateRequest specifies a request to create a snapshot of given
