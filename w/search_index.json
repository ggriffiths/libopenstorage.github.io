API\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the OpenStorage API documentation. Here you will find the\nAPI functions, examples, and references to multiple client libraries which can\ncommunicate with an OpenStorage server.\nQuick Example\nHere is a quick example of how to get cluster information from an OpenStorage\nserver. In this example we will be using the mock SDK container as the\nserver. First let's start the container by running the following command:\n$ docker run --rm --name sdk -d -p 9100:9100 -p 9110:9110 openstorage/mock-sdk-server\nThis container starts a tiny, in-memory OpenStorage SDK server able to be used\nfor development. More information can be found in the Tutorial.\nNow we can send requests from the command line. To send requests to the gRPC\nserver, we will use Polyglot\nas the gRPC client. To send requests to the gRPC REST Gateway, we will be\nsending the same request as Polyglot, but using curl instead:\ngRPCREST$ wget https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/polyglot/releases/download/v1.6.0/polyglot.jar\n$ echo {} | java -jar polyglot.jar \\\n  --command=call \\\n  --endpoint=localhost:9100 \\\n  --full_method=openstorage.api.OpenStorageCluster/InspectCurrent$ curl -X GET \"http://localhost:9110/v1/clusters/current\" \\\n     -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n\t -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n\t -d \"{}\"\nResults in:\n{\n  \"cluster\": {\n    \"status\": \"STATUS_OK\",\n    \"id\": \"mock\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe mock-sdk-server container also comes with a full Swagger\nUI located at http://localhost:9110/swagger-ui/.\nWhat's next\nCheck out:\n\nArchitecture\nInstallation\nTutorials\n\n"},"arch.html":{"url":"arch.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\n\nOverview\nThe software development kit for OpenStorage is based on gRPC,\nallowing clients to be automatically generated in multiple languages. The SDK\nalso provides a gRPC REST Gateway which automatically changes REST requests\nto gRPC.\nDifferent OpenStorage drivers may run the OpenStorage gRPC and REST servers on\ndifferent ports. Please, refer to your deployed driver documentation for\ninstructions on how to setup a connection to the gRPC server.\nOpenStorage API calls are ment to be idempotent to ensure consistency across calls, unless\notherwise specified.\nProtocol Buffers gRPC Source File\nThe gRPC bindings are created from api/api.proto file\navailable in the OpenStorage github repo.\nREST gRPC Gateway\nREST clients can benefit from the SDK server's gRPC REST Gateway\nwhich is able to translate REST calls to gRPC requests.\nSwagger is also provided by going to the REST gRPC Gateway\nand passing the path /swagger-ui.\nError Handling\nAll API calls use the standard gRPC status.\nOpenStorage SDK Implementations\nIn this document, examples will refer to both the OpenStorage SDK Mock\nand Portworx OpenStorage drivers.\n"},"installation.html":{"url":"installation.html","title":"Installation","keywords":"","body":"Installing OpenStorage SDK\nClients\nCurrently, OpenStorage provides Python, Ruby, Golang, and JavaScript bindings\nunder the api/client/sdk\ndirectory.

Each tutorial will provide an introduction to programming\nyour OpenStorage system.\nSetting up the mock-sdk-server\nFor simplicity these tutorials will use the mock-sdk-server provided by the\nOpenStorage project. It is an in-memory storage system implementation of the\nOpenStorage SDK and it makes it possible to develop your client by simply\nrunning a container on your laptop or system.\nRun the following command to start the server:\n$ docker run --rm --name sdk -d -p 9100:9100 -p 9110:9110 openstorage/mock-sdk-server\nRunning this docker command will expose port 9100 for the gRPC server, and\nport 9110 for the gRPC REST Gateway connection. As shown in the Architecture,\nthe gRPC REST Gateway translates simple REST requests to gRPC requets.\nThis document assumes that you will be running the container on your system,\ntherefore it will refer to the connetion as localhost. If you have the container\nrunning on another system, you will need to change the server location\naccordingly.\nLet's test the connection now before continuing by running the following to the\ngRPC REST Gateway:\n$ curl -X GET \"http://localhost:9110/v1/cluster\" \\\n     -H \"accept: application/json\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d \"{}\"\nThis should return information about the cluster in JSON format, for example:\n{\"cluster\":{\"status\":\"STATUS_OK\",\"id\":\"mock\"}}\n\n"},"tutorial-golang.html":{"url":"tutorial-golang.html","title":"Golang","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial: Golang\nIn this tutorial you will learn to setup your environment, create a volume,\nthen take its snapshot, create cloud credentials, and create a backup of the\nvolume.\nThe sources for this tutorial are available in the examples/golang directory in the repo for this website.\nSetting up your environment\nTo setup your environment, you will need to import the following to gain\naccess to api.pb.go:\nimport (\n    \"github.com/libopenstorage/openstorage/api\"\n\n    \"google.golang.org/grpc\"\n    \"google.golang.org/grpc/status\"\n)\n\nOnce you have imported this library into your project, you will have access\nto the OpenStorage SDK Golang client which was generated from the protobuf\nfile api.proto.\nWith the mock-sdk-server\nrunning, the following steps will provide an introduction to programming\nwith the OpenStorage SDK.\nCreating a connection\nTo use any of the gRPC functions, you must first create a connection with\nthe OpenStorage SDK server:\n    // Setup a connection\n    conn, err := grpc.Dial(\"localhost:9100\", grpc.WithInsecure())\n    if err != nil {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error: %v\", err)\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n\n\nNOTE: Notice the call grpc.WithInsecure(). The mock-sdk-server\ncurrently does not support HTTPS or authentication, so the tutorial will\nonly focus on an insecure connection. The SDK project will add HTTPS and\nauthentication support in following releases.\n\nCluster operations\nNow that we have made a connection, we can use the conn object to create\nclients for each of the services we would like to use. Let's use the OpenStorageCluster\nservice to print the id of the cluster and how many nodes it has:\n    // Create a cluster client\n    cluster := api.NewOpenStorageClusterClient(conn)\n\n    // Print the cluster information\n    clusterInfo, err := cluster.InspectCurrent(\n        context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkClusterInspectCurrentRequest{})\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Connected to Cluster %s\\n\",\n        clusterInfo.GetCluster().GetId())\n\nNotice the status.FromError() call above. As mentioned in the\nArchitecture all errors are encoded using the\nstandard gRPC status. To gain access to the error code and its message you\nmust use status.FromError() which decodes the error value and the message.\nNotice also the use of accessors GetXXX() above. These convenient functions\nare provided automatically be the golang protobuf generator.\nVolume Operations\nNow that we have connected to the cluster, let's go ahead and create a\nvolume of size 100Gi:\n    // Create a 100Gi volume\n    volumes := api.NewOpenStorageVolumeClient(conn)\n    v, err := volumes.Create(\n        context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkVolumeCreateRequest{\n            Name: \"myvol\",\n            Spec: &api.VolumeSpec{\n                Size: 100 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,\n            },\n        })\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Volume 100Gi created with id %s\\n\", v.GetVolumeId())\n\nNotice the value of Name provided above. This value is important since\nit allows for the function to be idempotent. In other words, this function\nwill always return the same volume id for the volume of same name.\nYou can now create a snapshot of this volume:\n    snap, err := volumes.SnapshotCreate(\n        context.Background(),\n        &api.SdkVolumeSnapshotCreateRequest{\n            VolumeId: v.GetVolumeId(),\n        },\n    )\n    if err != nil {\n        gerr, _ := status.FromError(err)\n        fmt.Printf(\"Error Code[%d] Message[%s]\\n\",\n            gerr.Code(), gerr.Message())\n        os.Exit(1)\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"Snapshot with id %s was create for volume %s\\n\",\n        snap.GetSnapshotId(),\n        v.GetVolumeId())\n\nAs you can see from the above, working with OpenStorage SDK is quite easy,\nfun, and powerful. Please refer to the API Reference\nfor a complete list of services.\n"},"tutorial-python.html":{"url":"tutorial-python.html","title":"Python","keywords":"","body":"Tutorial:
